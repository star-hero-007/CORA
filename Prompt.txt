# Comprehensive Prompt for Synthetic Airline Customer Churn Dataset Generation

Generate a realistic synthetic airline customer churn dataset with **10,000 rows** based on the feature specifications below. The dataset must be statistically plausible, properly balanced, and reflect real-world airline customer behavior patterns.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Class Balance
- **Target Variable**: `Churned` (binary: 0 = Active, 1 = Churned)
- **Distribution**: 50% churned (5,000), 50% active (5,000)
- Ensure churn is distributed naturally across all demographic segments and loyalty tiers

### 2. Statistical Realism
- Features must exhibit realistic correlations (e.g., high loyalty tier correlates with more flights, longer engagement)
- Include natural variance and noise to avoid artificial patterns
- Temporal features should follow realistic travel seasonality patterns
- Avoid deterministic relationships between features

### 3. Demographic Diversity & Balance
- **Age Bands**: Distribute evenly across 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 65+ (16.67% each)
- **Home Regions**: North America (25%), Europe (25%), Asia-Pacific (25%), Middle East (15%), Latin America (10%)
- **Traveller Types**: Business (40%), Leisure (45%), Mixed (15%)
- **Income Segments**: Low (20%), Medium (50%), High (30%)

## Feature Specifications

### **Passenger Profile & Seasonality**

1. **Passenger_Demographic_Segment** (categorical)
   - Combine: `Age_Band` + `Home_Region` + `Traveller_Type` + `Income_Segment`
   - Example: "36-45_Europe_Business_High"

    - Churned customers: mean = 1

---

### **Composite Indicators**

    - Weighted: `(Delay_Rate × 0.3) + (Cancellation_Count × 15) + (Baggage_Mishandling × 20)`
    - Values > 60 strongly predict churn

29. **Behavioural_Drift_Score** (float, 0-100)
    - Composite of deviations across travel, spend, engagement
    - Values > 70 indicate high churn risk
    - Distribution: mean = 35, sd = 22

30. **Engagement_Trend_Index** (float, -3.0 to +2.0)
    - Multi-channel engagement trend
    - Negative = fading engagement
    - Churned: typically -2.5 to -0.5

---

## Critical Correlation Rules

1. **Loyalty Tier correlations**:
   - Higher tiers → more flights, higher ancillary purchases, lower Days_Since_Last_Flight
   - Platinum/Gold churn primarily after service disruptions (high Disruption_Stress_Score)

2. **Churn patterns**:
   - Churned customers: low Rolling_Flights, high Days_Since_Last_Flight, negative engagement slopes
   - Active customers: regular flight activity, recent logins, positive/neutral trends

3. **Service experience**:
   - Multiple cancellations/delays → higher Support_Ticket_Count → higher churn probability
   - Long resolution times amplify churn risk

4. **Digital disengagement precedes flight churn**:
   - Days_Since_Last_Login should increase before Days_Since_Last_Flight increases

Generate a challenging, realistic synthetic airline customer churn test dataset with 200 rows based on the feature specifications below. This test set must be deliberately designed to challenge machine learning models by including edge cases, ambiguous patterns, and counter-intuitive scenarios that reflect real-world complexity.

Core Requirements for Challenging Test Data
1. Class Balance

Target Variable: Churned (binary: 0 = Active, 1 = Churned)
Distribution: 50% churned (100), 50% active (100)

2. Deliberate Complexity & Ambiguity
The test set should include:

Contradictory signals: Customers with mixed positive/negative indicators
Edge cases: Boundary conditions that are difficult to classify
Anomalous patterns: Customers who defy typical churn profiles
Subtle distinctions: Cases where churned and active customers look very similar
Feature interactions: Complex multi-feature patterns rather than single obvious predictors

3. Challenging Scenario Types (Include All)
Type A: High-Risk Active Customers (20 rows)

Show strong churn signals BUT remain active
Examples:

High Days_Since_Last_Flight (120-150) but just booked multiple future flights
Poor service experience but high loyalty tier with recent engagement spike
Negative engagement trends but sudden recent activity burst
Multiple complaints but increasing ancillary purchases



Type B: Low-Risk Churned Customers (20 rows)

Show positive engagement signals BUT actually churned
Examples:

Recent login activity but no bookings (browsing competitors)
Good service history but silent churn after tier downgrade
High email engagement but zero flight activity
Moderate flight history but abrupt stop with no warning signals



Type C: Borderline Cases (40 rows)

Features that hover exactly at decision boundaries
Examples:

Days_Since_Last_Flight = 90-120 (ambiguous zone)
Exactly 1 flight in last 3 months (could go either way)
Moderate disruption scores (40-50 range)
Flat engagement trends (slope near 0)



Type D: Contradictory Multi-Feature Patterns (30 rows)

Strong positive signals in some dimensions, strong negative in others
Examples:

High loyalty tier + frequent past flights BUT long gap + zero engagement
Excellent service experience BUT dramatic booking intent drop
Active digital engagement BUT declining flight activity
High ancillary purchases on last trip BUT no activity since



Type E: Seasonal/Situational Ambiguity (20 rows)

Patterns that could be explained by legitimate reasons vs. churn
Examples:

Business travelers with natural 4-6 month gaps between busy periods
Leisure travelers with annual vacation patterns
Recent life events (could be temporary pause or permanent churn)
Geographic seasonality effects



Type F: Premium Customer Edge Cases (20 rows)

Platinum/Gold tier customers with unusual patterns
Examples:

Platinum churned after single major service failure
Gold tier with declining activity but still above Bronze baseline
Recent tier achievers with unstable behavior
High-value customers switching to competitor while maintaining minimal activity



Type G: Silent Churn vs. Natural Gaps (30 rows)

Difficult to distinguish between temporary inactivity and true churn
Examples:

Moderate gaps (60-150 days) with no clear indicators either way
Past irregular travelers now in gap period
Low engagement but no negative service experiences
Gradual, slow decline vs. sudden drop



Type H: Noise and Outliers (20 rows)

Statistical outliers and unusual combinations
Examples:

Extreme values in single features but normal otherwise
Very frequent flyers who suddenly stop
Near-zero activity customers who are actually active (new signups)
Data quality issues simulation (missing patterns, inconsistencies)

Specific Challenge Requirements
1. Reduced Feature-Target Correlation

Weaken the predictive power of individual features by 30-40%
Example: If Days_Since_Last_Flight > 180 predicts churn 95% in training, make it 60-70% in test

2. Increased Feature Noise

Add 15-20% more variance to continuous features
Include measurement errors and inconsistencies

3. Counter-Intuitive Patterns

At least 25% of rows should have "surprising" labels given their features
Force models to rely on complex interactions rather than simple rules

4. Balanced Difficulty Distribution
- Easy cases (clear signals): 15% (30 rows)
- Medium cases (some ambiguity): 35% (70 rows)
- Hard cases (very ambiguous): 35% (70 rows)
- Very hard cases (counter-intuitive): 15% (30 rows)
5. Feature Interaction Emphasis

Create scenarios where churn can ONLY be predicted by combining 3+ features
Single features should be unreliable predictors

6. Demographic Distribution Shift

Slightly different from training distribution to test generalization:

Business travelers: 50% (vs 40% training)
Platinum/Gold: 35% (vs 30% training)
Age 36-55: 40% (vs 33% training)




Output Format
CSV file with 200 rows and 31 columns (30 features + 1 target variable Churned). Include header row with exact feature names.

Quality Checks for Test Set
The generated test set should satisfy:

✓ No single feature should have >70% correlation with churn
✓ At least 40% of rows should have contradictory signals across features
✓ Distribution of continuous features should overlap significantly between classes
✓ Include at least 10 "near-impossible" cases that even humans would struggle to classify
✓ Feature importance ranking should differ from training set
✓ Model accuracy should be expected to drop 10-20% compared to training/validation performance

This test set will effectively evaluate model robustness, generalization, and ability to handle real-world complexity rather than just memorizing obvious patterns.
